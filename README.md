#### Description: The project is a web-based application designed to provide users with information about movies, including details such as movie titles, genres, release dates, and ratings. Users can search for movies, view details, and manage a list of their favorite films. The application aims to deliver an intuitive and engaging user experience, leveraging modern web technologies and APIs. The web application is for searching movies in database and select which movie you prefer to add your favorites, it implements a lot of features in flask. first, login page to log the user in the web application and it checks for validity if the user doesn't enter the username or password and if the user enters a wrong password or username it shows him an error message after login page there's a register page for register user into the database and also check for validity if the user doesn't enter username or password or confirmation or user enters confirmation password but it's not like the password he entered before. after login page, it takes user for the page which can search for movies, we applied quries to search for data into movies.db, it shows data in unordered list and beside it an add button for adding movies to his favorites and when he search it routes user for search page which includes input form and a button for search and it takes the input and put it to query into database and if user inputs no input in search, it will show him an error message. After that add button for inserting into database, it inserts the title, director name, year, votes, ratings into database after multiple queries into database and if the user added the same movie before, it shows him a message that "You added this movie before" and if it's a new movie, it shows him a message "movie added to favorites" and stuff like that. after that, it takes him for favorites which is responsible for showing him his favorites and a button beside it for remove a movie from a database. After that, change password for changing password into database and it checks for inputs are correct and if user doesn't input a value, it shows him an error message and if he entered a wrong old password, it shows him that the old password is wrong and if he entered a new password that doesn't match the confirmation password, it shows him another error message. the project implements a lot of technologies like HTML/CSS and flask framework which helps us make a backend web development and the HTML pages I used to browse between them are favorites.html, layout.html, login.html, password.html, register.html, search.html, and username.html each one of them uses for a perspective like favorites.html shows data in a table using tr and td and some jinja in it for showing row data row by row and added button for delete the data you want and passing movie title to get it in app.py and layout.html which uses bootstrap included in the file first movies this will be shown in top left and when you click on it, it routes you to login page and then it checks for the buttons that we need to show based on the session user_id and it shows you search and favorite and logout and change password and in login.html is for showing two inputs and a button and the inputs are for getting input from the user and the button for log the user in using form with method post and it routes the user to login page. after that password.html and it takes three inputs and a button for getting data from the user also and it routes to password page to change password. and I added some jinja for checking the error message if the user doesn't enter an input or something else like enter a wrong old password and in register.html it gets three inputs from the user and a register button for registering user into database as I said above. And I added some classes for bootstrap to make it fancier and beautiful for the client-side and in search.html I added some jinja for displaying message for the user if the user doesn't enter an input for search or if the user added a movie to the database I created a form for search with action search and method post for searching and it takes input for query search and a button to search about the movie title you want and then I add a button for adding movie beside the unordered list by using jinja to show me a list of movies and button beside it. and I use jinja to display each row in the list.
